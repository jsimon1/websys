Jeremy Simon - Quiz 1
I've commented most of my work so my thoughts are mostly explained there, but to summarize the work on this quiz, I created loadData.js, a quick script that uses the JQuery .ajax call. I use .ajax since I've used it before, I know it does the job I need it to do, and I'm more comfortable with it then the higher-level ajax calls. Since I decided to put all the information on the page under this script, I can ensure all data is loaded at the same time (so in the event that the server is struggling to load the xml file, the titles wouldn't just be dangling there as the data is being loaded). So I put the welcome, the titles for the table, and then the entries are looped through the XML file to load all the labs and homeworks. All of this leaves index.html to be just a skeleton of only the necessities. The markup is semantic in nature as the div's are named after the data that it is expected to display. Finally, the virtual host is setup in .htaccess in the root for both lab1.websys and just websys, which points to index.html in the root.

Using the .ajax() and .append() jquery commands, I set up a short script to transfer the data from the JSON file into a div cell with proper styling to keep the table aligned both vertically and horizontally. Initially I tried to just insert the data directly into the appropriate given divs (#title,#artist, etc.), but that didn't work as different sized entries made the table not vertically aligned since there was no connection from each given div to keep them aligned, so I made a universal cell div with a defined height and width. I tried to use the nth-child css selector to set my favorite song in jquery using the css command after printing the playlist, but for some reason it didn't work.
